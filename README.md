# ManeuverQueue

ManeuverQueue is an add on for Kerbal Space Program that allows you to sort and filter objects displayed in the Tracking Station list. It was developed and tested against KSP v1.1.3

## Installation

You can build from source or download here [https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/ksp-maneuverqueue] (https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/ksp-maneuverqueue). Add the contents of the archive to your KSP GameData folder. 

## Usage

When the add on is installed you will see a small toolbar at the top left of the Tracking Station. Switching modes will sort and filter the list in the tracking station. All vessel type filters apply normally.

MET

- Shows the default Tracking Station list

MNV

- Shows only those ships with maneuvers nodes
- Sorts ships by maneuver node time, earliest first
- Ships with maneuver node times in the past will appear at the top of the list
- A ship is only listed once even if it has multiple maneuver nodes

A-Z

- Shows the default list, sorted alphabetically

## Known Issues

This is a very simple plugin but is also my first foray into KSP modding. It has not been thoroughly tested, and although I have no reason to believe anyone would encounter serious game-corrupting issues, back up your save game until your confident it works well for you. That said, these things could use some testing and feedback from anyone who's feeling helpful: 

- Layout on various screen configurations
- New objects spawning in the Tracking Station (e.g. Unknown Objects)
- Renaming in the Tracking Staion (currently disbaled in 1.1.3?)
- Tracking/Untracking objects
